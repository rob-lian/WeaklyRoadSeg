The weak supervision road segmentation is mainly divided into three stages which are the Generation of local inhomogeneous road probability map, the road area segmentation using the standard Support Vector Machine and the road fitting according to the road probability map. The generation of road probability is based on the road points detection (ref the paper: DeepWindow: Sliding Window Based on Deep Learning for Road Extraction From Remote Sensing Images), and the code can be download at https://github.com/rob-lian/DeepWindow. the SVC segmentation method is implemented by calling sklearn.svm. We provide the code of LBF which also can be downloaded on the official web site (http://www.engr.uconn.edu/~cmli/) .
